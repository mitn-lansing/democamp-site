What is Demo Camp?
Demo Camp Lansing is where the local tech community comes together to showcase their latest creations. 
Whether you've built an app, designed a website, created a gadget, or launched a startup, this is your stage to share it with fellow makers and innovators.

In a relaxed, friendly atmosphere, you'll see cutting-edge technology, meet passionate creators, and discover what's emerging in our vibrant tech scene. 
It's part show-and-tell, part networking, and all about celebrating the spirit of creation.

Get involved with Demo Camp Lansing by reaching out in the "Lansing Codes" website or slack: https://www.lansing.codes/
